This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router DOM v6 where nested routes with parameters don't function as expected when using `Routes` and `Route`. The issue arises when a route with parameters is nested within another route. The solution involves restructuring the routes using the `useParams` hook appropriately within the nested components, ensuring the correct parameter is used for specific routes.
